# SparkSetup
The Spark Soft AP setup library is meant for integrating the initial setup process of Spark devices in your app.
This library will enable you to easily invoke a standalone setup wizard UI for setting up internet-connect products
powered by a Spark Photon/P0/P1. The setup UI can be easily customized by a customization proxy class available to the user
that includes: look & feel, colors, fonts as well as custom brand logos and instructional video for your product.

## Usage

### Basic
Import `SparkSetupMainController.h` in your view controller implementation file, and invoke setup wizard by:
```Objective-C
SparkSetupMainController *setupController = [SparkSetupMainController new];
[self presentViewController:setupController animated:YES completion:nil];
```

### Customization

Customize setup look and feel by #importing `SparkSetupCustomization.h`,
access the SparkSetupCustomization singleton appearance proxy using 
```Objective-C
[SparkSetupCustomization sharedInstance]
```
and modify its self-explanatory properties.

### Advanced

You can get an active instance of `SparkDevice` by making your viewcontroller conform to protocol `<SparkSetupMainControllerDelegate>` when Setup Wizard completes:
```Objective-C
-(void)sparkSetupViewController:(SparkSetupMainController *)controller didFinishWithResult:(SparkSetupMainControllerResult)result device:(SparkDevice *)device;
```
will be called. and if `(result == SparkSetupMainControllerResultSuccess)` the device parameter will contain an active `SparkDevice` instance you can interact with
using the Spark-SDK.

(Extended usage instructions coming soon)
