# Spark-Setup
The Spark Soft AP setup library is meant for integrating the initial setup process of Spark devices in your app.
This library will enable you to easily invoke a standalone setup wizard UI for setting up internet-connect products
powered by a Spark Core/Photon. The setup UI can be easily customized by a customization proxy class available to the user
that includes: look & feel, colors, fonts as well as custom brand logos and instructional video for your product.
